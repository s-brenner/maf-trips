Privacy Policy

Slopes is owned, operated, and maintained by Consumed by Code (“us”). Consumed by Code respects your right to privacy and shares your concern about the security of any data you may submit via our mobile application (“Slopes”, or the “app”) or through its web site (the “site”), currently accessible at getslopes.com.

Your privacy is critically important to us. We don’t want to be creepy stalkers or evil spammers. We have a few fundamental principles:

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
The following statement discloses the guidelines Consumed by Code has established for protecting the information you provide to us during your visit to the site and while using the app.

Location Data

Slopes includes various location-based features such as tracking outdoor winter sports activities. To provide these location-based features Slopes will use precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your mobile device, when you use the app.

This location data is stored locally on your phone and you may delete it at any time. If you sign up for a Slopes account we will store a copy of this location data on our servers to provide online backup and synchronization between all your devices.

For some third-party partners, such as Google, location-based information will be shared automatically (the app uses Google Maps and shows your current position, for example). For others, such as social media networks, this information will only be shared with your explicit permission or if you choose to share it.

Aggregated Statistics

We may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our website and users of the app. For example, we may aggregate anonymous location data to report resort popularity or publish a report on trends in the usage of Slopes.

If you're a Season Pass holder, you'll be using MapBox for terrain maps. They collect annonymous information about how people use their mapping service. Opting out of anonymous statistics for Slopes will also opt you out of their metrics. You can read about how they use your annonymous data here TL;DR? They're cool, and not creepy, otherwise we wouldn't be using them.

Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Consumed by Code collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use the site.

Email Communications

If you choose to stop receiving emails regarding Slopes, please follow the unsubscribe instructions within each email communication or send an email to hello@getslopes.com. We will not provide or share any mailing lists or other information about you to another company or service for promotional purposes.

Any service-related emails (help requests, feedback, etc.) generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the service you requested.

Data Security

Slopes uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal and location information during transmissions to our servers.

We restrict access to data to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve the app. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline if they fail to meet those obligations.

HealthKit

Slopes can optionally integrate with Apple's HealthKit to save off calorie data to your local health database. If fitness tracking is enabled for an activity this health data will be saved locally and in the health store, but will not be stored online in any way or shared with any other third-party services. If you export copies of your activities that health data is not included.

Children

We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13 and do not target our websites to children under 13. If you are under thirteen, please do not submit any data through the app or site.

We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children to never provide personal data through any of our app or site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our servers.

Exclusions

This privacy policy does not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us, such as feature requests and feedback sent via our support channels. All unsolicited information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution.

Disclaimer

While we continue to work hard to protect your data, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Consumed by Code. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk.

Privacy Policy Changes

If Consumed by Code makes changes to any terms or conditions of this privacy policy, these changes will be posted on the site in a timely manner. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. In case of a business transaction in which a portion or all of Consumed by Code’s business is acquired, we will notify you as described above in this paragraph.

Contact Us

If you have any additional questions or concerns about this policy or our information practices, please feel free to contact us at any time at hello@getslopes.com.
