## Welcome to TimeHack

TimeHack is the result of my frustration with reading GDSS2 cuts and trying to figure out mission timing in both UTC and local time. Check it out on the [App Store](https://s-brenner.github.io/time-hack/index) if you hate math in public too.

### Features

Create a trip and add as many legs as you need. Creating a leg is simple. All you need is the departure field, takeoff time, landing field and arrival time.

From there, TimeHack will generate timing
**for the trip:**
- x
- x

**and for each leg:** 
- Stop SCUBA
- Enter Crew Rest
- Stop Drinking
- Legal For Alert
- Expected Alert
