## Welcome to MAF Trips

MAF Trips is the result of my frustration with reading GDSS2 cuts and trying to figure out mission timing in both UTC and local time. I don't have time to think about Julian dates past January. [Download MAF Trips](https://s-brenner.github.io/maf-trips/index) if you hate public math too.

### Features

Create a trip and add as many legs as you need. Creating a leg is simple. All you need is the departure field, takeoff time, landing field and arrival time. From there, MAF Trips will generate timing
