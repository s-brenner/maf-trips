# MAF Trips and Your Data

I don't want to do anything creepy with your data. I charge users directly for MAF Trips so I can avoid having to sell your data or do anything else questionable to make money and stay in business. I may use some of your data responsibly to improve MAF Trips, but that's it.

Let's unpack how I use and store your data:

## A) Identifiable Data: If You Don't Have a MAF Trips Account

* All your data stays local to your phone and never hits the MAF Trips servers.
* You don't have an account or any purchase history, so there's nothing there to send to my servers, either.

## B) Identifiable Data: With a MAF Trips Account

### What specifically do I store, and how?

At this point I'm giving you free online backup / sync, which does mean your timing data is now on my servers.

* Data transmitted via the app to and from MAF Trips servers is encrypted following industry best practices.
* Personally identifiable account information stored on my servers is encrypted and stored in such a way to prevent public access.
* More generic data about your flying preferences such as how long before you step to the aircraft you commence your crew brief or how long prior to engine start you prefer to have your passengers arrive, etc are also stored on my servers along side your account information to provide sync.

### What I do with your uploaded data?

I act responsibly with it. Beyond what is needed to run MAF Trips I will not share your data with third parties, unless you enable a third-party integration.

I will never, ever, sell your data.

How is your data shared with third parties so I can run MAF Trips?

* Your location data, account metadata, purchase history, and timing metadata are stored on the third-party servers I pay for to host sync and run MAF Trips.
* If you email in and ask for assistance your email address and our conversations are also then stored within my customer service helpdesk provider.

How is your data used inside MAF Trips?

* If you email in with a problem I will access your data, as needed, to assist with the problem.
* I may privately use your location or generic timing data to improve MAF Trips. For example, I may use the timing preferences for users at a particular base in a particular airframe to update the default timing settings for that context.
* If I do access your data I will never publish it, even combined with a lot of other users' data at that same location to make it anonymous, publically.

What data may be shared with other users of MAF Trips?

* Right now, nothing
* In the future, I may share your first and last name, your base, and your aircraft, and any trip you deem public and might want to share with fellow crewmembers at your base.
* If at any point you'd like to remove all of your data from the MAF Trips servers you can do so in-app under Settings -> Account -> Delete.
